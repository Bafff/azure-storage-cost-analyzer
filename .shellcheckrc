# ShellCheck configuration file for Azure Storage Cost Analyzer
# This file configures which ShellCheck warnings to ignore

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# Rationale: This is a style preference. We use this pattern extensively for readability
# and the return values we're capturing (from commands like jq, echo, etc.) are not
# critical for error handling in our use cases.

# SC2034: Variable appears unused
# Rationale: Many config variables are declared but may be used in future features
# or are placeholders for configuration options. They're intentionally defined.

# SC2001: See if you can use ${variable//search/replace} instead
# Rationale: sed usage is more readable for complex patterns and is intentional

# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting
# Rationale: In our specific use cases with controlled inputs, this is safe
# We explicitly handle this where needed

# SC2207: Prefer mapfile or read -a to split command output
# Rationale: mapfile is not available in older bash versions. Our pattern is compatible

# SC2188: Redirection doesn't have a command
# Rationale: We use "> file" intentionally to truncate files, which is valid bash

# SC2129: Consider using { cmd1; cmd2; } >> file instead of individual redirects
# Rationale: Individual redirects are more readable for our use case

# SC2154: Variable is referenced but not assigned
# Rationale: We use nameref/indirect variable references in functions that manipulate
# arrays passed by name. This is a valid bash pattern for our use case.

# SC2184: Quote arguments to unset
# Rationale: Array indices in unset commands don't need quoting in our controlled context
